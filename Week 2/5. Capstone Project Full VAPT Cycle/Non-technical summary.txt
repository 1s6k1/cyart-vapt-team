A security assessment identified a weakness in the web application that allows attackers to interact directly with the database. By manipulating a user input field, it was possible to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This issue could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and loss of customer trust if exploited in a real-world environment. The risk level is considered high because the attack requires minimal effort and can be automated. To reduce risk, the application should validate user inputs properly, secure database access, and be retested after fixes are applied.
