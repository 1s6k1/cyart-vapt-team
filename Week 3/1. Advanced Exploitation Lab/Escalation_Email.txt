Subject: Critical Security Issue: Command Injection Leading to Root Access
Dear Development Team,

During a recent security assessment on the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine, a critical command injection vulnerability was identified in the web application. By manipulating user-supplied input, an attacker was able to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This initial access was further leveraged to obtain a reverse shell and escalate privileges to root level due to insecure system configurations.

This vulnerability poses a high risk, as it allows complete system compromise. We recommend implementing strict input validation, avoiding direct OS command execution, and applying the principle of least privilege. Please prioritize remediation and validation testing.

Regards,
Suresh Kumar P
