This assessment identified multiple security weaknesses within the web application that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access and compromise sensitive data. Critical issues such as SQL Injection allow attackers to bypass login controls and interact directly with backend databases, while Cross-Site Scripting enables session hijacking and user impersonation. Weak password enforcement further increases the likelihood of account compromise. These vulnerabilities pose significant business and reputational risks. Implementing secure coding practices, strengthening authentication controls, and conducting regular security assessments will greatly reduce exposure and improve the application’s overall security posture.
