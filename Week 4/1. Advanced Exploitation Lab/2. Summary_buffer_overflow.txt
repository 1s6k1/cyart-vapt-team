The Exploit‑DB Python PoC for CVE‑2021‑44790 was modified by parameterizing the target URL and multipart boundary, modularizing payload creation, and adding basic error handling and output messages. These changes improve readability, reuse, and controlled testing while preserving the original exploit logic and demonstrating the Apache mod_lua multipart buffer overflow in a lab environment.
